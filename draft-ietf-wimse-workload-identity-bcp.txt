          OAuth 2.0 Client Assertion in Workload Environments
             draft-ietf-wimse-workload-identity-bcp-latest

Abstract

   The use of the OAuth 2.0 framework for container orchestration
   systems poses a challenge as managing secrets, such as client_id and
   client_secret, can be complex and error-prone.  Instead of manual
   provisioning these credentials the industry has moved to a
   federation-based approach where credentials of the underlying
   workload platform are used as assertions towards an OAuth
   authorization server leveraging the Client Assertion Flow [RFC7521],
   in particular [RFC7523].

   This specification describes a meta flow in Section 3.1, gives
   security recommendations in Section 4 and outlines concrete patterns
   in Appendix A.

1.  Introduction

   Workloads often require access to external resources to perform their
   tasks.  For example, access to a database, a web server or another
   workload.  These resources are protected by an authorization server
   and can only be accessed with an access token.  The challenge for
   workloads is to get this access token issued.

   Traditionally, workloads were provisioned with client credentials and
   use the corresponding client credential flow (Section 1.3.4
   [RFC6749]) to retrieve an access token.  This model comes with a set
   of challenges that make it insecure and high-maintenance.  Secret
   materials need to be provisioned and rotated, which often happens
   manually.  It also can be stolen and used by attackers to impersonate
   the workload.

   A solution to this problem is to not provision secret material to the
   workload and use the platform the workload runs on to attest for it.
   Many workload platforms offer a credential, in most cases a JWT
   token.  Signed by a platform-internal authorization server, the
   credential attests the workload and its attributes.  Based on
   [RFC7521] and its JWT profile [RFC7523], this credential can then be
   used as a client assertion towards a different authorization server.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   For the scope of this specification, the term authorization server is
   only used for the authorization server of the external authorization
   domain as highlighted in Figure 1.

   Even though, technically, the platform credential is also issued by
   an authorization server within the workload platform, this
   specification only refers to it as "platform issuer" or just
   "platform".

3.1.  Overview

   Figure 1 illustrates a generic pattern that applies across all of the
   patterns described in Appendix A:

    |  +--------------------------+    push   +-------------+  |
    +----------------------------------------------------------+

      Figure 1: OAuth2 Assertion Flow in generic Workload Environment

   The figure outlines the following steps which are applicable in any
   pattern.

   *  1) retrieve credential issued by platform.  The way this is
      achieved and whether this is workload (pull) or platform (push)
      initiated differs based on the platform.

   *  2) present credential as an assertion towards an authorization
      server in an external authorization domain.  This step uses the
      assertion_grant flow defined in [RFC7521] and, in case of JWT
      format, [RFC7523].

   *  3) On success, an access token is returned to the workload to
      access the protected resource.

   *  4) The access token is used to access a protected resource in the
      external authorization domain.  For instance by making a HTTP
      call.

   Accessing different protected resources may require steps 2) to 4)
   again with different scope parameters.  Accessing a protected
   resource in an entirely different authorization domain often requires
   the entire flow to be followed again, to retrieve a new platform-
   issued credential with an audience for the external authorization
   server.  This, however, differs based on the platform and
   implementation.

3.2.  Credential format

   For the scope of this document we focus on JSON Web Token credential
   formats.  Other formats such as X.509 certificates are possible but
   not as widely seen as JSON Web Tokens.

   The claims in the present assertion vary greatly based on use case
   and actual platform, but a minimum set of claims are seen across all
   of them.  [RFC7523] describes them in detail and according to it, all
   MUST be present.

   {
     "iss": "https://example.org",
     "sub": "my-workload",
     "aud": "target-audience",
     "exp": 1729248124
   }

   For the scope of this specification, the claims can be described the
   following.  Everything from [RFC7523] applies.

   iss
      The issuer of the workload platform.  While this can have any
      format, it is important to highlight that many authorization
      servers leverage OpenID Connect [OIDC] and/or OAuth 2.0
      Authorization Server Metadata [RFC8414] to retrieve JSON Web Keys
      [RFC7517] for validation purposes.

   sub
      Subject which identifies the workload within the domain/workload
      platform instance.

   audience
      One or many audiences the platform issued credential is eligible
      for.  This is crucial when presenting the credential as an
      assertion towards the external authorization server which MUST
      identify itself as an audience present in the assertion.

4.  Security Recommendations

   All security considerations in section 8 of [RFC7521] apply.

4.1.  Issuer, subject and audience validation

   Any authorization server that validates and accepts platform-issued
   credentials MUST take the following claims into account before
   accepting assertions:

   *  Issuer

   *  Subject

   *  Audience

   *  Expiration

   Failure to verify any of these properties can result in impersonation
   or accepting an assertion that was issued for a different purpose.

4.2.  Token type validation

   Authorization servers MUST validate the token type of the assertion.
   For example, OAuth Refresh or ID tokens MUST NOT be accepted.

4.3.  Custom claims are important for context

   Some platform issued credentials have custom claims that are vital
   for context and are required to be validated.  For example in a
   continuous integration and deployment platform where a workload is
   scheduled for a GIT repository, the branch is crucial.  A 'main'
   branch may be protected and considered trusted to federate to
   external authorization servers, other branches may not be and are not
   allowed to access protected resources.

   Authorization servers that validate assertions SHOULD make use of
   these claims.  Platform issuers SHOULD allow differentiation based on
   the subject claim alone.

4.4.  Token lifetime

   Tokens SHOULD NOT exceed the lifetime of the workloads they
   represent.  For example, a workload that has an expected lifetime of
   an hour should not receive a token valid for 2 hours or more.

   For the scope of this specification, where a platform issued
   credential is used to authenticate to retrieve an access token for an
   external authorization domain, a short-lived credential is
   recommended.

4.5.  Workload lifecycle and invalidation

   Platform issuers SHOULD invalidate those when the workload stops,
   pauses or ceases to exist.  How these credentials are invalidated is
   not in scope of this specification.

4.6.  Proof of possession

   Credentials SHOULD be bound to workloads and proof of possession
   SHOULD be performed when these credentials are used.  This mitigates
   token theft.  This proof of possession applies to the platform
   credential and the access token of the external authorization
   domains.

Appendix A.  Patterns

A.1.  Kubernetes

   In Kubernetes, the primary concept of machine identity is implemented
   through "service accounts" [KubernetesServiceAccount].  These
   accounts can be explicitly created or a default one is automatically
   assigned.  Service accounts utilize JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) [RFC7519]
   as their credential format, with these tokens being cryptographically
   signed by the Kubernetes Control Plane.

   Service accounts serve multiple authentication purposes within the
   Kubernetes ecosystem.  They are used to authenticate to Kubernetes
   APIs, between different workloads and to access external resources
   (which is particularly relevant to the scope of this document).

   To programatically use service accounts, workloads can:

   *  use the Token Request API [TokenReviewV1] of the control plane

   *  have the token projected into the file system of the workload.
      This is commonly referred to as "projected service accout token".

   Both options allow workloads to:

   *  specify a custom audience.  Possible audiences can be restricted
      based on policy.

   *  specify a custom lifetime.  Maximum lifetime can be restricted by
      policy.

   *  bind the token lifetime to an object lifecycle.  This allows the
      token to be invalidated when the object is deleted.  For example,
      when a Kubernetes Deployment is removed from the server.  It is
      important to highlight, that invalidation is only in effect if the
      Token Review API [TokenReviewV1] of Kubernetes is used to validate
      the token.

   To validate service account tokens, Kubernetes offers workloads to:

   *  make us of the Token Review API [TokenReviewV1].  This API
      introspects the token, makes sure it hasn't been invalidated and
      returns the claims.

   *  mount the public keys used to sign the tokens into the file system
      of the workload.  This allows workloads to decentrally validate
      the tokens signature.

   *  Optionally, a JSON Web Key Set [RFC7517] is exposed via a
      webserver.  This allows the Service Account Token to be validated
      outside of the cluster and without line of sight towards the
      actual Kubernetes Control Plane API.

    Figure 2: OAuth2 Assertion Flow in a Kubernetes Workload Environment

   The steps shown in Figure 2 are:

   *  1) The Kubernetes Control Plane schedules the workload.  This is
      much simplified and technically happens asynchronously.

   *  2) The Kubernetes Control Plane projects the service account token
      into the workload.  This step is also much simplified and
      technically happens alongside the scheduling with step 1.

   *  3) Workloads present the projected service account token as a
      client assertion towards an external authorization server
      according to [RFC7523].

   *  4) On success, an access token is returned to the workload to
      access the protected resource.

   *  5) The access token is used to access the protected resource in
      the external authorization domain.

   Service Account token carries.

A.2.  Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone (SPIFFE)

   Secure Production Identity Framework For Everyone, also known as
   SPIFFE, is a cloud native compute foundation (CNCF) adopted project
   which defines an API defined called "Workload API" to delivery
   machine identity to workloads.  Workloads can retrieve either X509
   based or JWT credentials without the need to authenticate making it
   very easy to use.  How workloads authenticate on the API is not part
   of the specification.  It is common to use platform metadata from the
   operating system and the workload platform for authentication on the
   Workload API.

   For the scope of this document, the JWT formatted credential is the
   most relevant one.  SPIFFE referres to it as "JWT-SVID" (JWT - SPIFFE
   Verifiable Identity Document).

   Workloads are required to specify at least one audience when
   requesting a JWT-SVID from the Workload API.

   To allow validation, SPIFFE offers

   *  to download a set JWK encoded public keys that can be used to
      validate JWT signatures.  In SPIFFE this is referred to as the
      "JWT trust bundle".

   *  invoke a validation method on the Workload API to validate JWT-
      SVIDs

   Additionally, many SPIFFE deployments choose to separately publish
   the signing keys as a JSON Web Key Set on a web server to allow
   validation where the Workload API is not available.

   The following figure illustrates how a workload can use its JWT-SVID
   to access a protected resource outside of SPIFFE.

          Figure 4: OAuth2 Assertion Flow in a SPIFFE Environment

   The steps shown in Figure 4 are:

   *  1) The workload request a JWT-SVID from the SPIFFE Workload API
      with an audience that identifies the external authorization
      server.

   *  2) The workload presents the JWT-SVID as a client assertion in the
      assertion flow based on [RFC7523].

   *  3) On success, an access token is returned to the workload to
      access the protected resource.

   *  4) The access token is used to access the protected resource in
      the external authorization domain.

   The claims of a JWT-SVID for example look like this:

   {
     "aud": [
       "external-authorization-server"
     ],
     "exp": 1729087175,
     "iat": 1729086875,
     "sub": "spiffe://example.org/myservice"
   }

A.3.  Cloud Providers

   Workload in cloud platforms can have any shape or form.
   Historically, virtual machines were the most common, with the
   introduction of containerization, hosted container environment or
   Kubernetes clusters were introduced, and lately, serverless functions
   are offered.  Regardless of the actual workload packaging,
   distribution and runtime platform, all are in need of identity.

   To create a common identity interface across cloud services and
   offerings, the pattern of an Instance Metadata Endpoint has been
   established by the biggest cloud providers.  Next to the option for
   workloads to get metadata about themselves, it also allows them to
   receive identity.  The credential types offered can vary.  JWT,
   however, is the one that is common across all of them.  The issued
   credential allows proof to anyone it is being presented to, that the
   workload platform has attested the workload and it can be considered
   authenticated.

   Within a cloud provider the issued credential can often directly be
   used to access resources of any kind across the platform making
   integration between the services easy and credential less.  While the
   term is technically misleading, from a user perspective, no
   credential needs to be issued, provisioned, rotated or revoked, as
   everything is handled internally by the platform.

   Resources outside of the platform, for example resources or workloads
   in other clouds, generic web servers or on-premise resources, are
   most of the time, however, protected by different domains and
   authorization servers and deny the platform issued credential.  In
   this scenario, the pattern of using the platform issued credential as
   an assertion in the context of [RFC7521], for JWT particularly
   [RFC7523] towards the authorization server that protected the
   resource to get an access token.

           Figure 5: OAuth2 Assertion Flow in a cloud environment

   The steps shown in Figure 5 are:

   *  1) The workload retrieves identity from the Instance Metadata
      Endpoint.

   In case the workload needs to access a resource within the cloud
   (protected by the same authorization server that issued the workload
   identity)

   *  A1) The workload directly access the protected resource with the
      credential issued in step 1.

   In case the workload needs to access a resource outside of the cloud
   (protected by a different authorization server).  This can also be
   the same cloud but different context (tenant, account).

   *  B1) The workload presents cloud-issued credential as an assertion
      towards the external authorization server using [RFC7523].

   *  B2) On success, an access token is returned to the workload to
      access the protected resource.

   *  B3) Using the access token, the workload is able to access the
      protected resource in the external authorization domain.

A.4.  Continuoues integration/deployment systems

   Continuous integration and deployment systems allow their pipelines/
   workflows to receive identity every time they run.  Particularly in
   situations where build outputs need to be uploaded to resources
   protected by other authorization server, deployments need to be made,
   or more generally, protected resources to be accessed, [RFC7523] is
   used to federate the pipeline/workflow identity to an identity of the
   other authorization server.

        Figure 6: OAuth2 Assertion Flow in a continuous integration/
                           deployment environment

   The steps shown in Figure 6 are:

   *  1) The continuous integration / deployment platform (CI-CD
      platform) schedules a task (considered a workload) to be
      performed.

   *  2) The workload is able to retrieve identity from the CI-CD
      platform.  This can differ based on the platform and potentially
      is already supplied during scheduling phase in step 1.

   *  3) The workload presents the CI-CD issued credential as an
      assertion towards the authorization server in the external
      authorization domain based on [RFC7521].  In case of JWT also
      [RFC7523].

   *  4) On success, an access token is returned to the workload to
      access the protected resource.

   *  5) Using the access token, the workload is able to access the
      protected resource in the external authorization domain.

   Tokens of different providers look different, but all of them contain
   claims carrying the basic context of the executed tasks such as
   source code management data (e.g. git branch), initiation and more.

Appendix B.  Variations

B.1.  Direct access to protected resources

   Resource servers that protect resources may choose to trust multiple
   authorization servers, including the one that issues the platform
   identities.  Instead of using the platform issued identity to receive
   an access token of a different authorization domain, workloads can
   directly use the platform issued identity to access a protected
   resource.

   In this case, technically, the protected resource and workload are
   part of the same authorization domain.

B.2.  Custom assertion flows

   While [RFC7521] and [RFC7523] are the proposed standards for this
   pattern, some authorization servers use [RFC8693] or a custom API for
   the issuance of an access token based on an existing platform
   identity credentials.  These pattern are not recommended and prevent
   interoperability.
