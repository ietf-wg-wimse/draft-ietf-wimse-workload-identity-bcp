      "body": "Following the discussion on the mailing list, I wanted to give my take on the different options to provision the workload with the token.  Maybe we can use it to start the discussion before starting the PR. \r\n\r\nIdentity provision mechanisms:\r\nCurrent workload systems mainly rely on three solution to provide the Identity to a running workload:\r\n1. Environmental variables: they provide the easiest solution to inject the container with information, but presents some drawbacks:\r\n* Static nature: the information are injected when the container is started and cannot be modified at runtime\r\n * Access control: restricting access to environmental variable is more challenging and are usually exposed inside logs and to debugging tools\r\nENV variables should be used with short-live credentials, when simplicity is a requirement.\r\n2. Volumes, i.e., Projected volumes as named in Kubernetes, offer the possibility to pass information through the file-system. This allows to inject dynamical credentials, rotate them and perform a better access control. The main drawbacks of this solution is the additional complexity. Indeed, the solution requires multiple configurations:\r\n* The files need to have a proper access control definition, to prevent the unauthorized access of a different process\r\n* The mounted volume needs to be correctly isolated to prevent a compromised container to be able to gain more control over the host machine\r\n* The additional burden of monitoring the different workload to maintain valid credentials in each container (this last element can be handled by the orchestrator). \r\nThe main advantages of this approach, with respect to the previous one, is in a better access control of the resource and the possibility to rotate the credentials without the need to restart the container. This solution fits well when multiple different process in the container need to access the credential's file.\r\n3. Loopback interface relies on a local endpoint, usually exposing an HTTP or a gRPC interface, to provide the identity information to the workload. This solution, present additional advantages to the cost of complexity:\r\n* Limiting the exposure of the credential thanks to the properties of network isolation in the loopback interface. \r\n* It also allows an on-demand fetching and rotation of the credentials. \r\nNevertheless, there are also some drawback in using this solution:\r\n* The dependency on the network stack, which may differ based on the host machine, and creating a one-for-all solution might require additional code.\r\n* The additional latency due to the request and the increase of the operational overhead.\r\nThis approach should be preferred in conjunction with side-cars/agents and centrally managed identities solutions for application that requires dynamic credentials. \r\n",

Token Request API which would also require the workload to know how to use this API and to have all permissions to request an access token with the intended audience and so forth, or\r\n2. a service account token projected into the file system, for instance, /var/run/secrets/client-abcde/assertion\r\n\r\nThis approach serves as a protective mechanism against token reuse, misuse, and malicious actions from workloads. By doing this, an AS never receives an assertion it could reply against the Kubernetes API. Additionally, workloads will find it significantly harder (whether intentionally or unintentionally) to share their access tokens with other workloads without detection.\r\n\r\nAs a random note on this, I'm also curious to see how K8s Token Request API would evolve over the time... In terms of providing a lightweight DPoP mechanism for its SA ATs.",

Workloads can use this token to authenticate themselves towards APIs of the platform control plane. Even though this token is used for access it can be more considered an ID Token rather than an Access Token in the OAuth context. Workloads don't get issued a refresh token nor does authorization or consent play a role. It is merely a proof that the workloads is who it claims to be. Workloads have various options available to retrieve such token from the Kubernetes platform, for example via a `TokenRequest` API invoked by business logic or `Token volume projection` which mounts the token into the file system of the workloads and keeps it up to date there. `Token volume projection` having the advantage of not requiring any manual effort by the application besides reading a file.\r\n```",
